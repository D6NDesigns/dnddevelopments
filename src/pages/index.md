        Adding a house extension to your home is a very good idea and straight
        forward. If you have not yet extended your house to the back or side,
        why not go ahead, it will certainly give you more space to move around
        your home, will most probably double the kitchen or living room and also
        increase the total value of your property, should you sell or let in the
        future.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
